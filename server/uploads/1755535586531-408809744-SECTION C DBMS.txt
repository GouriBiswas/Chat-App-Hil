Q21. What is normalization?
A: Organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. 1NF removes repeating groups, 2NF removes partial dependencies, and 3NF removes transitive dependencies.

Q22. What is indexing?
A: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations in a database.

Q23. Write a query to find the second highest salary.
A (SQL):

SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

Q24. Difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
A: DELETE removes rows one-by-one (can be rolled back); TRUNCATE removes all rows quickly without logging (cannot be rolled back).

Q25. What is a primary key and a foreign key?
A: A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

Q26. What is a transaction in DBMS?
A: A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. It must follow ACID properties — Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

Q27. What is a JOIN? Name its types.
A: A JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.

Q28. Difference between WHERE and HAVING clause?
A: WHERE is used to filter rows before grouping, while HAVING is used to filter groups after aggregation.

Q29. What are views in SQL?
A: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL query. It does not store data itself but presents data from one or more tables.

Q30. What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered index?
A: A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. A non-clustered index is a separate structure with pointers to the data.

Q31. What is a stored procedure?
A: A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save and reuse. It helps reduce redundancy and improves performance.

Q32. What is a trigger?
A: A trigger is a SQL code that automatically runs in response to certain events on a table or view, like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

Q33. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?
A: CHAR is fixed-length, while VARCHAR is variable-length. CHAR is more efficient for fixed-size values.

Q34. What are constraints in SQL?
A: Constraints are rules enforced on data columns like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and DEFAULT.

Q35. What is denormalization?
A: Denormalization is the process of adding redundancy to a database to improve read performance.

Q36. How do you prevent SQL injection?
A: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of dynamic SQL, and validate user inputs.

Q37. What is a composite key?
A: A composite key is a combination of two or more columns used to uniquely identify a record.

Q38. Explain ACID properties.
A: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability — together they ensure safe and correct transaction processing.

Q39. What is a subquery?
A: A subquery is a query nested within another query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

Q40. Difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?
A: INNER JOIN returns matching rows. OUTER JOIN returns matched + unmatched rows from one or both tables (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).
